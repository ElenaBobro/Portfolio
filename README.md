# Obesity Data Analysis: Interactive Report

This report is designed for analyzing obesity levels across individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. It includes various visualizations and analyses that help understand trends, correlations, and factors affecting obesity levels.

## Key Features:

 **Obesity Level by Gender** – A pie chart displays the distribution of obesity levels across different genders (Male, Female).

 **Obesity Level by Age** – An interactive graph shows the correlation between age and obesity level, providing insights into how age affects obesity trends.

 **Physical Activity vs Obesity** – A bar chart illustrates the average physical activity levels (FAF) across different obesity categories.

 **Impact of Eating Habits** – A table analyzes the relationship between eating habits (e.g., frequency of snacks, calorie consumption) and obesity levels.

This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, correlation study, and generating actionable insights for health and wellness decision-making.

# Obesity Data Analysis

In this project, data analysis was conducted concerning obesity levels among individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. The aim of the analysis was to explore the impact of various factors such as gender, age, height, heredity, eating habits, physical activity, and transportation on the obesity levels of individuals.

## Key Stages of Work:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationships between various variables such as age, height, and obesity level.
- **Pivot Tables**: Creating pivot tables to analyze the average levels of physical activity (FAF) based on obesity levels.
- **Visualization of Results**: Presenting the main findings in the form of graphs and tables to better understand trends.

## Key Findings:
- There are significant differences in obesity levels between men and women, with women being more prone to Obesity_Type_III, and men to Obesity_Type_II.
- Higher physical activity is observed in people with normal weight, and it decreases with an increase in obesity levels.
- Heredity and eating habits, particularly snack frequency, significantly impact obesity levels.
- Alcohol consumption has no significant effect on obesity levels, while transportation is correlated with obesity levels, especially for individuals with higher levels of obesity.

## Recommendations:
- To prevent obesity, it is important to increase physical activity, reduce snack frequency, and manage eating habits.
- Given the decrease in activity with the increase in obesity levels, focus should be placed on mobility support programs for individuals with high levels of obesity.

  # Project: Google Analytics Data Analysis with BigQuery

In this project, I worked with Google Analytics data, executing various SQL queries using BigQuery to analyze session data of users. The tasks included calculating the number of sessions, distribution by device types, analyzing traffic sources, the most visited pages, average session duration, and more.

## Key stages:
- **Counting the number of sessions** – I used basic aggregate SQL functions to calculate the total number of sessions.
- **Filtering by a specific date** – I calculated the number of sessions that occurred on a specific day.
- **Analysis of session distribution by device type** – I calculated the number of sessions for each device type (desktop, mobile, tablet).
- **Identifying the most popular traffic sources** – I created a query to find the top 5 traffic sources by the number of sessions.
- **Identifying the most visited pages** – I found the top 10 pages with the most views.
- **Calculating average session duration** – I calculated the average time users spent on the website.
- **Analyzing countries with the highest number of sessions** – I identified the top 5 countries by the number of sessions.
- **Transaction and profitability analysis** – I determined the total number of transactions and revenue.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Google BigQuery** – Using SQL to work with large datasets in Google Cloud.
- **Google Analytics Data** – Data about user sessions, traffic sources, device types, and countries.

## Results:
I obtained numerical results that helped identify key trends on the website, such as the most popular devices, countries, traffic sources, and other indicators that are crucial for optimizing marketing strategies and improving the user experience.
